# Microsoft_Azure_50daysofUdacity

### Hi! This is LauraT. From July to October of 2020, I was accepted into the challenge phase of the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Scholarship and was later awarded a full scholarship to complete the Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure.  This is a record of my coding/learning challenge during the phase 1 of the scholarship.  Below is a badge for the full scholarship, awarded on October 13, 2020. <br>

#50daysofudacity Day 63 :tada:

[Thing came up last night so I had to wait till morning ET to post this but this was done yesterday.]
:cherry_blossom: I reviewed the lessons about linear regression. A quick summary: Linear regression is an algorithm that uses a straight line or plane to describe relationships between variables. There is simple linear regression (one input variable) and multiple linear regression (multiple input variables). To train a linear regression model is to learn the coefficients and bias that best fit the data. To do this, we use a cost function to minimize the coefficients and bias. :hamster_dance:
:cherry_blossom: I read an article about generative pre-trained transformer 3: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3?utm_source=pocket-newtab-global-en-GB :dancing_penguin:
:cherry_blossom: I took a further look at the original paper about GPT3: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165 :nerd_face:
:cherry_blossom: Hope your week is off to a good start! :rocket:



9.14.20

#50daysofudacity Day 64 :tada:

:cherry_blossom: I reviewed the units about functions, and in particular irreducible error and model error. A quick summary: Model error is generated when making predictions, which can be calculated by a cost function. It measures how much the prediction made by the model is different from the true output. Irreducible error is caused by the data collection process. An example would be not to have enough data or data features. :party_parrot:
:cherry_blossom: I learned an about several useful chatbots: https://www.userlike.com/en/blog/chat-bots-entrepreneurs :robot_face:
:cherry_blossom: Thank you to so many of you for sending encouraging messages after reading my student story. I’m overwhelmed by everyone’s good will, which just signifies how wonderful this community is. I’m grateful that I am here with you all. :sparkling_heart:
